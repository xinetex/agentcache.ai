# Investor & Strategy FAQ

## 1. The "Elevator Pitch" for Investors
**Q: What is AgentCache?**
**A:** "LLMs are the CPU of the AI era. We are the RAM."

**The Narrative:**
> "Every AI agent today has amnesia. They forget everything once the context window closes. We built the **'Memory Operating System'** that gives agents infinite, hierarchical memory (Hot/Warm/Cold) without the developer needing to build complex infrastructure. We are the missing persistence layer for the Agent Economy."

**Why it's worth money:**
We aren't just a "tool" (low value). We are **Infrastructure** (high value). We become the "database of record" for an Agent's life. Sticky. Hard to rip out.

## 2. Pricing Strategy (The Pivot)
**Old Model:** "Save money on API calls." (Race to the bottom).
**New Model:** "Enable Infinite Memory." (Premium capability).

### Recommended Tiers:

| Plan | Price | Feature | Psychology |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Developer** | **Free** | L1 (Hot) + L2 (Warm/Redis) | "Get hooked on the speed and cost savings." |
| **Pro** | **$29/mo** | **+ L3 (Vector/Infinite)** | "Unlock the 'Brain'. Essential for serious agents." |
| **Enterprise** | **Custom** | Private VPC, Custom Retention | "Data sovereignty and compliance." |

**Strategy:** Keep the "Cache" (L2) free/cheap because it's a commodity. Charge for the "Memory" (L3) because it's a superpower.

## 3. "What if someone offers to buy us?"
**Response:**
> "We are just scratching the surface. We have solved the 'Context Wall'—the biggest bottleneck in AI today—with a software-only solution that scales infinitely. We are building the standard for Agent Memory. We'd listen to offers that value us as a **Platform**, not a Feature."
