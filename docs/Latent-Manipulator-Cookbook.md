# The Latent Manipulator Cookbook.md

This guide explains the "Latent Manipulator," an experimental AI architecture designed to "think" in a latent space before generating text, contrasting with standard Transformer models that predict text sequentially. It includes the theory, code for implementation, and links to datasets and pretrained model checkpoints.

## Why a Latent Manipulator? The Theory

Standard Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are typically based on the **Transformer** architecture. Their core operation involves predicting the *next word* (or token) in a sequence, given all the preceding words. This means their process of "thinking" or reasoning is intertwined with the act of generating text word-by-word. If you ask ChatGPT, "Can you think quietly before writing?", it might say yes, but architecturally, it *can't* – its computation *is* the generation process.

Humans, however, can often form an "idea" or grasp the semantics of a concept before finding the exact words to express it. The Latent Manipulator architecture attempts to mimic this separation:

1.  **Idea Space (Latent Space):** We need a way to represent the *meaning* or *idea* of a piece of text numerically, separate from the text itself. This is achieved using an **Autoencoder**.
    *   **Encoder:** Takes text as input and compresses it into a dense numerical vector (e.g., 1024 numbers). This vector lives in the "latent space" and represents the "idea" of the input text.
    *   **Decoder:** Takes a vector from the latent space and reconstructs the original text (or a close approximation).
    *   **Bottleneck:** The crucial part is the "bottleneck" in the middle of the autoencoder (the latent space itself), which forces the model to learn a compact, meaningful representation of the input.

2.  **The Latent Manipulator (Thinking Engine):** This is a separate model (which doesn't *have* to be a Transformer) that operates *entirely within the latent space*.
    *   It takes the latent vector representing the *question* (generated by the Encoder).
    *   It performs computations on this vector to transform it into a *new* latent vector representing the *answer*.
    *   This transformation is the "thinking" process, happening *without generating any text*.

3.  **Generating the Answer:** The resulting latent vector (the "idea" of the answer) is then fed into the **Decoder** part of the autoencoder, which converts this "idea" back into human-readable text.

**In essence: Text Question -> Encoder -> Latent Question -> Latent Manipulator -> Latent Answer -> Decoder -> Text Answer.**

This separation offers potential advantages:
*   **True "Thinking":** Allows computation on semantic meaning before articulation.
*   **Multilingual Potential:** The latent space could potentially become language-agnostic. You could train different Encoder/Decoder pairs for various languages but use the *same* Latent Manipulator for reasoning, promoting consistency across languages.
*   **Efficiency & Control:** Manipulating smaller latent vectors might be more efficient than full text generation for certain reasoning tasks.

### 1. Setup: Loading the Autoencoder

We use a pre-trained T5 model that has been adapted into a bottlenecked autoencoder. This model provides the `embed` (text to latent) and `generate_from_latent` (latent to text) functionalities.


```python
# Define the Autoencoder Abstraction (Helper Class)
# Note: This requires the specific model code from 'thesephist/contra-bottleneck-t5-large-wikipedia'
# Ensure you have 'trust_remote_code=True' when loading if needed.
class BottleneckT5Autoencoder:
    def __init__(self, model_path: str, device='cpu'):
        self.device = device
        print(f"Using device: {self.device}")
        self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path, model_max_length=512)
        # Ensure trust_remote_code=True if the model requires custom code
        self.model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_path, trust_remote_code=True).to(self.device)
        self.model.eval() # Set to evaluation mode

    @torch.no_grad()
    def embed(self, text: str) -> torch.FloatTensor:
        """Encodes a single string into a latent embedding."""
        inputs = self.tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt', truncation=True, max_length=512).to(self.device)
        # Decoder input starts with the beginning-of-sequence token for T5-like models
        decoder_input_ids = torch.tensor([[self.tokenizer.pad_token_id]], dtype=torch.long).to(self.device)

        # Generate the latent embedding
        outputs = self.model(
            input_ids=inputs['input_ids'],
            attention_mask=inputs['attention_mask'],
            decoder_input_ids=decoder_input_ids, # Provide initial decoder input
            encode_only=True, # Flag to get the bottleneck representation
        )
        # The exact output structure might vary; inspect 'outputs' if needed.
        # Assuming the latent vector is the first element.
        return outputs[0]


    @torch.no_grad()
    def embed_batch(self, texts: list[str]) -> torch.FloatTensor:
        """Encodes a batch of strings into latent embeddings."""
        inputs = self.tokenizer(
            texts,

            truncation=True,
            max_length=512
        ).to(self.device)

        # Prepare decoder start tokens for the batch
        decoder_start_token_id = self.model.config.decoder_start_token_id
        if decoder_start_token_id is None:
             decoder_start_token_id = self.tokenizer.pad_token_id # Fallback if not defined

        decoder_input_ids = torch.full(
            (len(texts), 1),
            decoder_start_token_id,
            dtype=torch.long,

        )

        if latent.dim() == 1:
            latent = latent.unsqueeze(0)
        latent = latent.to(self.device)

        # Use the model's generate method with the latent vector
        # This relies on the custom model code handling the 'latent_vector' parameter
        output_sequences = self.model.generate(
            encoder_outputs=None, # We provide latent directly, not standard encoder outputs

        )
        # Decode the first sequence
        return self.tokenizer.decode(output_sequences[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

```

```python
# --- Initialize the Autoencoder ---
# Set your Hugging Face token if needed
# os.environ["HF_TOKEN"] = "your_huggingface_token"

# Determine device (adjust as needed: 'cuda', 'mps', 'cpu')
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = 'cuda'
elif torch.backends.mps.is_available(): # For Apple Silicon
    device = 'mps'
else:
    device = 'cpu'

# Load the pre-trained autoencoder model
model_path = 'thesephist/contra-bottleneck-t5-large-wikipedia'
autoencoder = BottleneckT5Autoencoder(model_path=model_path, device=device)
print("Autoencoder loaded successfully.")
```

### 2. Data Preparation

The training data for the Latent Manipulator consists of pairs of latent embeddings: one for the instruction (question) and one for the response (answer).

#### a) Combining Raw Data (if needed)

The example uses the LaMini dataset, provided as Parquet files. If your data is similar, you first need to combine these into a single file (e.g., JSONL).

You can find the raw data i used in [https://huggingface.co/datasets/MBZUAI/LaMini-instruction/tree/main/data]

```python
# --- Combine Parquet files into a single JSONL (Example) ---
parquet_dir = "/path/to/your/parquet/files/" # Directory containing the .parquet files
output_jsonl_file = "/path/to/save/merged_output.jsonl"
parquet_files = glob.glob(os.path.join(parquet_dir, "train-*.parquet"))

print(f"Found Parquet files: {parquet_files}")

# Use 'append' mode to allow resuming if interrupted
with open(output_jsonl_file, "a", encoding="utf-8") as outfile:
    for file_path in tqdm(parquet_files, desc="Processing Parquet files"):
        try:
            df = pd.read_parquet(file_path)
            print(f"Read {len(df)} rows from {os.path.basename(file_path)}")
            # Iterate through DataFrame rows and write as JSON lines
            for _, row in tqdm(df.iterrows(), total=len(df), desc="Writing JSONL", leave=False):
                # Ensure columns 'instruction' and 'response' exist
                if 'instruction' in row and 'response' in row:
                     json_record = json.dumps({"instruction": row['instruction'], "response": row['response']})
                     outfile.write(json_record + '\n')
                else:
                     print(f"Skipping row due to missing columns: {row.to_dict()}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error processing {file_path}: {e}")

print(f"Finished merging Parquet files into {output_jsonl_file}")
```

#### b) Generating Embeddings

Convert the text instruction/response pairs from the JSONL file into latent embeddings using the autoencoder and save them to a NumPy file. This uses checkpointing to handle large datasets and allow resuming.


```python
# --- Generate Embeddings from JSONL ---

# Configuration
checkpoint_interval = 100_000 # Save progress every N lines
input_jsonl_file = "/path/to/save/merged_output.jsonl" # Input JSONL file from previous step
embeddings_file = "/path/to/save/embeddings.npy" # Output NumPy file
checkpoint_file = "/path/to/save/checkpoint.txt" # Checkpoint file

batch_size = 64 # Adjust based on your GPU memory

# --- Function to process batches ---
def process_batch(batch_texts_instructions, batch_texts_responses, autoencoder_model):
    if not batch_texts_instructions or not batch_texts_responses:
        return [], []

### 3. Latent Manipulator Model Code

This defines the neural network that learns to map question embeddings to answer embeddings. The architecture shown uses multiple feed-forward layers with skip-connection-like features (concatenating intermediate "choked" outputs).

*   **Input:** 1024-dimensional latent vector (from Encoder).
*   **Architecture:** A series of Linear layers, BatchNorm, LeakyReLU, and Dropout. Intermediate outputs are "choked" (reduced) to 2048 dimensions and concatenated with the original input before final aggregation layers. This complex structure aims to handle deep transformations while mitigating vanishing/exploding gradients.
*   **Output:** 1024-dimensional latent vector (to be fed to Decoder).

### 4. Training the Latent Manipulator

This involves setting up a dataset to efficiently load the pre-computed embeddings and a training loop.

#### a) Dataset Class

Uses NumPy's memory mapping (`mmap_mode='r'`) to avoid loading the entire (potentially huge) embeddings file into RAM. It loads only the required question-answer pair for each `__getitem__` call.

```python
# --- NumPy Embedding Dataset ---
class NPYEmbeddingDataset(Dataset):
    """
    Lazily loads pairs of embeddings (instruction, response) from a NumPy file
    using memory mapping for efficiency with large files.
    Assumes embeddings are stored sequentially: [instr1, resp1, instr2, resp2, ...].
    """
    def __init__(self, npy_file):
        self.npy_file = npy_file
        # Load with mmap_mode to get shape/dtype without loading all data
        try:
             with np.load(npy_file, mmap_mode='r') as data:
                 self.shape = data.shape
                 self.dtype = data.dtype
        except FileNotFoundError:
             print(f"Error: NPY embedding file not found at {npy_file}")
             raise
        except Exception as e:
             print(f"Error loading NPY file: {e}")
             raise


        if len(self.shape) != 2 or self.shape[0] % 2 != 0:
            raise ValueError(f"Expected a 2D numpy array with an even number of rows (embeddings). Got shape: {self.shape}")
            
        self.num_pairs = self.shape[0] // 2
        self.embedding_dim = self.shape[1]
        print(f"Dataset initialized: {self.num_pairs} pairs, embedding dim {self.embedding_dim}")


    def __len__(self):
        """Returns the number of instruction-response pairs."""
        return self.num_pairs

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        """Loads the idx-th instruction and response embedding pair."""
        if idx >= self.num_pairs:
            raise IndexError("Index out of bounds")
            
        # Load with mmap_mode again inside __getitem__ for multi-process loading safety
        # This ensures each worker gets its own file handle if num_workers > 0
        data = np.load(self.npy_file, mmap_mode='r')
        
        # Calculate row indices for the pair
        q_idx = idx * 2
        a_idx = idx * 2 + 1
        
        # Extract the embeddings and convert to tensors
        q_emb = torch.from_numpy(data[q_idx].copy()).float() # Use .copy() with mmap
        a_emb = torch.from_numpy(data[a_idx].copy()).float()
        
        return q_emb, a_emb
```

#### b) Training Loop

Standard PyTorch training loop using the defined dataset and model. Key features:
*   **Loss:** Mean Squared Error (`MSELoss`) because we are comparing output embeddings to target embeddings (regression).
*   **Optimizer:** AdamW is a good default choice.
*   **Learning Rate Scheduling:** `ReduceLROnPlateau` adjusts the learning rate based on validation loss (or average training loss here) stagnation. A *warmup* phase is also added to start with a lower LR and gradually increase it, improving stability early in training.
*   **Gradient Clipping:** Prevents exploding gradients, crucial for deep networks.
*   **Checkpointing:** Saves the model state periodically, especially when the loss improves.

### 5. Inference: Using the Trained Model

To get an answer for a new question:
1.  Load the trained `LatentManipulator` model from a checkpoint.
2.  Load the `BottleneckT5Autoencoder` (needed for encoding the question and decoding the answer).
3.  Encode the input question text into its latent vector using the autoencoder.
4.  Pass this latent vector through the loaded `LatentManipulator` to get the predicted latent vector for the answer.
5.  Decode this answer latent vector back into text using the autoencoder.

## Conclusion

The Latent Manipulator presents an intriguing alternative to standard sequential text generation. By separating the "thinking" (latent space transformation) from the "speaking" (text decoding), it opens up possibilities for potentially more efficient, controllable, and perhaps even language-agnostic reasoning in AI models. While still experimental, this approach highlights the ongoing exploration into different ways AI can process and generate information.
