## Email 1: Replicate Partnership

**To:** partnerships@replicate.com  
**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity - AgentCache (AI Caching for Your Models)

Hi Replicate team,

I'm building **AgentCache** (agentcache.ai) - an edge caching service for AI API calls that reduces costs by 90% and improves response times 10×.

We're launching an **integration marketplace** and Replicate is our #1 priority because:

- **Perfect fit:** Our users already cache LLM API calls (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- **Natural upsell:** "Cache Stable Diffusion, Llama, and other Replicate models too!"
- **Complementary value:** We reduce API costs, you provide amazing models

**What we're proposing:**

1. **Official Replicate integration** in our dashboard
   - One-click OAuth setup
   - Automatic caching of Replicate API responses
   - Dashboard widget showing: "Cached 500 Replicate calls (saved $50)"

2. **Affiliate partnership** 
   - 20% recurring commission (industry standard)
   - Tracked via UTM parameters + OAuth attribution
   - Monthly payouts via Stripe Connect

3. **Co-marketing opportunities**
   - Joint blog post: "How to cache Stable Diffusion for 10× speedup"
   - Case study featuring AgentCache + Replicate users
   - Featured placement in our marketplace (reaching 1K+ AI developers)

**What we need from you:**

- Affiliate program details (commission %, cookie duration, payout terms)
- OAuth integration docs (or API keys if OAuth not available)
- Marketing assets (logo, 1-sentence description, promo offer)
- Exclusive deal for AgentCache users (e.g., $50 in credits)

**About AgentCache:**

- 🚀 Launching Q1 2025 with 1,000+ beta users
- 💰 Users save $10K+ per month on AI API costs
- 🏗️ Built on Vercel Edge Functions + Upstash Redis
- 🎯 Target audience: AI developers, startups, agencies

Can we schedule a 15-minute call this week to discuss?

## Email 2: Modal Partnership

**To:** partnerships@modal.com  
**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity - AgentCache (AI Caching Platform)

Hi Modal team,

I'm building **AgentCache** (agentcache.ai) - the first edge caching service specifically for AI API calls. We reduce LLM costs by 90% and improve response times 10×.

We're reaching out because **Modal + AgentCache is a perfect pairing**:

- **Your strength:** On-demand GPU compute for AI workloads
- **Our strength:** Intelligent caching to reduce API costs
- **Together:** Complete cost optimization stack for AI developers

**Integration we're proposing:**

1. **Cache warming on Modal**
   - Users run `modal run cache_warming.py --model=gpt-4`
   - Pre-warm common queries overnight (batch processing)
   - Use your GPUs for embedding generation, fine-tuning, etc.

2. **Batch invalidation jobs**
   - Schedule cache invalidation on Modal Functions
   - Run expensive re-caching jobs on your infrastructure
   - Users see: "Cache warming job running on Modal (cost: $2.50)"

3. **Affiliate partnership**
   - 15% recurring commission
   - Natural upsell: "Need compute? Modal offers cheap GPUs."
   - Tracked via dashboard integration + UTM links

**Why this is valuable to Modal:**

- **Qualified leads:** Our users are AI developers with GPU needs
- **Natural workflow:** Cache API calls → Need compute for training/inference
- **Brand alignment:** Both focused on cost optimization for AI

**What we need:**

- Affiliate program details (commission %, terms)
- API integration docs (trigger jobs, check status, get logs)
- Exclusive offer for AgentCache users (free compute credits?)

**About us:**

- Launching with 1,000+ AI developers (Q1 2025)
- Average user spends $500-2K/month on AI infrastructure
- Built by [your background/credentials]

## Email 3: Helicone Partnership

**To:** team@helicone.ai  
**Subject:** Partnership Idea - AgentCache + Helicone (Caching + Monitoring)

Hey Helicone team!

I love what you're building with LLM observability - it's a huge pain point for AI developers.

I'm working on **AgentCache** (agentcache.ai) - an edge caching service that reduces LLM costs 90% and improves response times 10×.

**Here's why we should partner:**

1. **Non-competitive, complementary products**
   - You: Monitor LLM calls, analyze costs, track performance
   - Us: Cache LLM calls, reduce costs, improve latency
   - Together: Complete LLM stack (cache + monitor)

2. **Natural user flow**
   - User caches API calls with AgentCache
   - Forwards metrics to Helicone for monitoring
   - Dashboard shows: "Cached 80% of calls (Helicone monitoring active)"

3. **Co-marketing opportunity**
   - Bundle pricing: AgentCache + Helicone = 10% off both
   - Joint webinar: "Optimize your LLM costs with caching + monitoring"
   - Case study: "How Company X saved $10K/month"

**Proposed integration:**

- **Metrics forwarding:** AgentCache → Helicone API
  - Cache hits/misses
  - Latency per request
  - Cost savings
  - Token usage

- **Dashboard integration:** 
  - "Connect Helicone" button in our dashboard
  - Users enter Helicone API key
  - Automatic metric syncing

- **Affiliate partnership:**
  - 20% recurring commission both ways
  - We refer users to Helicone, you refer to AgentCache
  - Tracked via OAuth + UTM parameters

**Why this matters:**

- Your users want to reduce costs → We provide caching
- Our users want monitoring → You provide observability
- Win-win: We both grow, users save money + get insights

Want to explore this? I'm free for a quick call this week.

## Rejection Response Template

**Subject:** Re: Partnership Opportunity - AgentCache

Hi [Partner],

Thanks for getting back to me! I understand [Partner] isn't doing affiliate partnerships right now.

A few questions:

1. **Would you be open to a non-affiliate integration?**
   - We could still feature [Partner] in our marketplace
   - No commission, just helping users discover great services

2. **Are there other partnership models you're interested in?**
   - Co-marketing (blog posts, webinars, case studies)
   - Technical integration (OAuth, API, webhooks)
   - Referral program (one-time bonus vs recurring)

3. **Can we revisit in 6 months?**
   - We'll have more users + traction by then
   - Might make more sense for both sides

No pressure - just wanted to explore options! Thanks again for considering it.

Best,  
[Your Name]
