# AgentCache.ai Launch Plan

## ✅ DONE (Today)
- ✅ Professional landing page with pricing
- ✅ Updated to profitable pricing ($19/$49/$149)
- ✅ Server with Redis caching working locally
- ✅ Git repo initialized

## 🚧 IN PROGRESS  
- Fixing TypeScript/Drizzle ORM issues for deployment

## 📋 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Tonight/Tomorrow AM)

### Option A: Quick MVP (2 hours)
**Deploy simplified version WITHOUT database:**
1. Remove database dependency temporarily
2. Hardcode demo API keys for testing
3. Deploy landing page + caching API to Vercel
4. Test with real Redis on production
5. Add database layer next week

**Revenue Target**: Get 1-2 beta testers immediately

### Option B: Full System (6-8 hours)
**Fix all TypeScript errors:**
1. Debug Drizzle ORM type issues  
2. Get full auth + Stripe working
3. Deploy complete system

**Revenue Target**: First paying customer in 3-5 days

## 💰 RECOMMENDED: Option A
