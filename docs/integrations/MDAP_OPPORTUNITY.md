## What is MDAP?

**Massively Decomposed Agentic Processes (MDAPs)** solve the fundamental limitation of LLMs: error accumulation over long reasoning chains.

### The Problem MDAPs Solve

- Traditional LLMs fail after 100-200 reasoning steps
- Errors compound and derail long-range tasks
- Cannot scale to organizational-level processes

### The MDAP Solution

1. **Extreme Decomposition**: Break tasks into millions of tiny subtasks
2. **Microagents**: Each handles one atomic operation
3. **Multi-Agent Voting**: 3-5 agents vote on each decision for consensus
4. **Error Correction**: Mistakes caught and fixed immediately
5. **Proven Scale**: Successfully completed 1M+ step task with zero errors

## The Business Opportunity

### MDAP Creates a Massive Cost Problem That We Solve

**Example Task**: Supply chain optimization with 1M decision points

| Component | Calls | Cost |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Base microagent execution | 1,000,000 | $9,000 |
| Multi-agent voting (3x) | 2,000,000 | $18,000 |
| Error correction (~5%) | 150,000 | $1,350 |
| **Total** | **3,150,000** | **$28,350** |

Running this 20 times/month = **$567,000/month** or **$6.8M/year**

### Why MDAPs Are Perfect for Caching

1. **High Repetition**: Standardized subtasks repeat across workflows
2. **Voting Redundancy**: 2-5x redundant LLM calls per decision (instant cache hits)
3. **Deterministic**: Same input → same output
4. **Error Retries**: Failed steps re-execute identically (95%+ cache hit)

### AgentCache Impact

With 75% cache hit rate:
- **3.15M calls → 790k calls** (2.36M cached)
- **$28,350 → $7,100** per task
- **Save $21,250 per task** (75% reduction)
- **$425,000/month savings** at 20 tasks/month
- **$5.1M/year savings**
