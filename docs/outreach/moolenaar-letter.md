Dear Chairman Moolenaar,

I hope this letter finds you well. We met several years ago when I owned Taco Universe in Sanford, and I've followed your outstanding work on the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party with great interest. Your leadership in protecting American technology and data security has never been more critical.

I'm writing to bring to your attention a significant national security vulnerability in our rapidly expanding use of artificial intelligence—and to share how a Michigan-based company is solving it.

## The Problem: Massive Data Leakage to Chinese AI Companies

Federal agencies, defense contractors, and American businesses are increasingly using AI assistants powered by companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and others. However, many are unknowingly routing sensitive prompts and queries through **Chinese AI providers** like DeepSeek and Moonshot AI, which are subject to Chinese Communist Party data laws.

**The scale of exposure is staggering:**
- A typical government agency makes 1+ million AI queries per month
- Many of these are duplicate or similar questions
- Every duplicate query exposes the same sensitive data to foreign providers again
- There is currently no filtering mechanism to prevent Chinese AI access

**Example scenario:**
- DOE researcher asks: "Analyze this nuclear safety protocol for vulnerabilities"
- Query goes to DeepSeek (Chinese company)
- Same question asked 500 times by different staff = 500 exposures
- **All data subject to Chinese intelligence gathering laws**

## The Solution: AgentCache.ai

My team and I have built **AgentCache.ai**, an American-owned AI caching infrastructure that sits between government users and AI providers. Here's how it protects national security:

**1. Provider Filtering**
- Automatically blocks Chinese AI companies (DeepSeek, Moonshot) in government mode
- Only routes to vetted US-based providers
- Configurable compliance policies per agency

**2. 80-90% Reduction in Foreign Exposure**
- First query: routed to approved US provider, response cached
- All subsequent identical/similar queries: served from US-only cache
- **Result: 90% of queries never leave American infrastructure**

**3. Complete Audit Trail**
- Every cache operation logged with 7-year retention (FedRAMP requirement)
- Full visibility into which providers accessed what data
- Exportable compliance reports for IG audits

**4. Cost Savings**
- Reduces AI API costs by 90% (typical agency saves $100K-500K/year)
- Improves response time from 3-5 seconds to <50 milliseconds
- Self-funding security improvement

## FedRAMP Compliance Path

We are actively pursuing FedRAMP authorization with:
- US-only data residency (Virginia and California regions)
- SOC 2 Type II audit underway
- OSCAL-formatted control documentation
- Air-gapped deployment option for classified environments

## Business Model & Michigan Jobs

AgentCache is:
- **Incorporated in Michigan**
- Hiring security engineers and compliance specialists in the state
- Targeting $10M ARR by serving defense industrial base contractors
- Planning to hire 25-50 Michigan residents over the next 18 months

## Request for Support

I would be honored to discuss how AgentCache can support your committee's work in:

1. **Securing government AI infrastructure** from Chinese data collection
2. **Establishing best practices** for federal AI procurement
3. **Testifying** on AI supply chain security vulnerabilities
4. **Providing technical briefings** to committee staff

I'm also exploring how AgentCache could support the **Genesis Mission** goals around viewpoint neutrality and objective truth in government AI systems—we cache and audit what agencies are asking AI systems, providing transparency.

## Meeting Request

Would you or your staff be available for a 15-minute call to discuss how we can support your efforts to secure American AI infrastructure? I'm happy to provide a live demonstration of the platform.

Thank you for your continued service to Michigan and your leadership in protecting our national security. The work you're doing on the Select Committee is exactly what our country needs.

I look forward to reconnecting after all these years.

Respectfully,

[Your Name]
