## 🤝 Partnership Outreach Template

**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity - AgentCache (AI Caching Platform)

Hi [Partner],

I'm building **AgentCache** (agentcache.ai) - an edge caching service for AI API calls that reduces LLM costs by 90% and improves response times 10×.

We're launching an **integration marketplace** and [Partner] is a perfect fit because:
- Our users are AI developers who [use case: need GPU compute / store embeddings / monitor LLMs]
- Natural workflow: [AgentCache caching → Partner service]
- Mutual benefit: [specific value prop]

**Proposal:**
1. **Official integration** in our dashboard (reaching [X] developers)
2. **Affiliate partnership** with [X]% commission
3. **Co-marketing:** case study, blog posts, joint webinars

**What we need:**
- Affiliate program details (commission %, cookie duration, etc.)
- Technical integration docs (API keys, OAuth, etc.)
- Marketing assets (logo, description, promo offer)

Can we schedule a 15-minute call to discuss?

Best,  
[Your Name]  
Founder, AgentCache  
https://agentcache.ai
