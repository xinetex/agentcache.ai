## Outreach Template Email

**Subject**: AgentCache: Reducing AI Costs by 90% for Michigan Defense Contractors

**Body**:

Dear [Name],

I'm reaching out from AgentCache.ai, a Michigan-based company building secure AI infrastructure for the defense industrial base.

We've developed a solution that addresses two critical challenges your team likely faces:

1. **Cost**: AI API expenses can reach $500K+/year for engineering and operations teams
2. **Compliance**: Chinese AI providers (DeepSeek, Moonshot) don't meet CMMC or ITAR requirements

AgentCache reduces AI costs by **90%** while ensuring:
- ✓ Zero Chinese provider access (blocked at infrastructure layer)
- ✓ US-only data residency (Virginia + California)
- ✓ 7-year audit logs for compliance
- ✓ CMMC 2.0 ready

**ROI Example**: [Company Name] uses 1M AI queries/month:
- Without AgentCache: $20K/month ($240K/year)
- With AgentCache: $9K/month ($108K/year)
- **Savings: $132K/year** + improved security posture

Would you be open to a **15-minute call** to discuss how AgentCache could support your AI initiatives? I'm happy to provide a technical demo and compliance documentation.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]  
Founder, AgentCache.ai  
Midland, Michigan (Rep. Moolenaar's District)  
gov@agentcache.ai
