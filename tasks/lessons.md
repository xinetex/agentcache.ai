# Agent Lessons & Self-Improvement Log

## Session: Architecture & Process Standardization
- [x] **Consolidation**: Redundant interfaces (Admin Dash vs Mission Control) creating user confusion. *Fix: Merge immediately into single source of truth.*
- [ ] **Protocol**: User requires strict "Plan -> Verify -> Document" loop. `todo.md` and `lessons.md` are now mandatory.

## Active Rules (Self-Enforced)
1. **Plan First**: Never code without a checklist in `tasks/todo.md`.
2. **Verify**: Never mark done without proof (logs/screenshot).
3. **Elegance**: Pause before complex changes. Ask "Is there a simpler way?".
